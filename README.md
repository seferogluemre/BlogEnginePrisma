This FullStack project is a blog application built with TypeScript, Express, and Prisma, following the MVC architecture. The backend uses Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL database to manage essential data models such as category, post, tag, post-tag relationships, and comments.

On the frontend, React is used to create a dynamic interface that seamlessly integrates with the backend. Users can browse blog posts, filter them by categories, leave comments, and explore content through tags.

Technologies Used:
ðŸ”¹ Backend: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL
ðŸ”¹ Frontend: React, TypeScript, Axios, React Router

This setup ensures a clean and scalable code structure, making it well-suited for modern JavaScript/TypeScript development. ðŸš€
